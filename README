TODO:

1) translation for incoming TCP packets (the code should be pretty similar to
what I wrote for outgoing TCP packets)

2) cleaning up defunct mappings (sr_nat_timeout), including making the
timeout intervals configurable via command line flags

3) unsolicited inbound SYN packets (need to create a struct for these TCP SYNs
and a linked list of them in our NAT struct). “Your NAT MUST NOT respond to an
unsolicited inbound SYN packet for at least 6 seconds after the packet is
received. If during this interval the NAT receives and translates an outbound
SYN for the connection the NAT MUST silently drop the original unsolicited
inbound SYN packet. Otherwise, the NAT MUST send an ICMP Port Unreachable error
(Type 3, Code 3) for the original SYN. If your NAT cannot determine whether the
endpoints of a TCP connection are active, it MUST abandon the session if it has
been idle for some time. In such cases, the value of the "established connection
idle-timeout" MUST NOT be less than 2 hours 4 minutes. The value of the
"transitory connection idle-timeout" MUST NOT be less than 4 minutes. This value
MUST be configurable, as described below. EDIT: Note you MUST timeout idle
connections.”

4) TCP checksum

5) sr_nat_destroy
